# Hardhat implementation of eip-20

This repo deploys an implementation of the eip-20 standard for learning. It uses hardhat package to run deployments on ethereum goerli network. Please read up on the eip-20 standard [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) to get further information.

## Setup

To setup this repo firstly make sure you clone a local copy of this repo down to your workspace using git. Next download all the node modules needed here by running the following:

```
npm install
```

Now you'll need to setup the environment variable to be used in the deployment by creating a `.env` file with the following content:

```
GOERLI_RPC_URL="<goerli-rpc-url>"
PRIVATE_KEY=["<private-key-1>","<private-key-2>",...]
```

You can use a rpc provider like `infura` and `Alchemy` for goerli and your private key can be grabbed from metamask. **Please make sure not to commit your .env file up, this can lead to loss of funds.**

## Compile and deploy

To compile this solidity code you'll need to run hardhat cli using `npx` like the following:

```
npx hardhat compile
```

Now you should be able to deploy your contract to goerli. To do this run the following:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Your output should look like the following:

```
